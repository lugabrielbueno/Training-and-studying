# Training and studying
 
 First repository

 Repository designed to contain all my progress in development, such as exercises, small projects and some examples of classes.
Among the projects contained in this repository, all were completed in less than 1 day.

.Txt and .mp3 files etc, were used in some exercises where such files were requested, such as: Play music or edit text from an existing file.
